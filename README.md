Operating platforms

1) The Gaming Room was a client focusing on gaming software. Their main goal with the project was to have a program designed to work with various operating systems for their hit mobile game "Draw It or Lose It", and bring in desktop users to participate as well.

2) I will admit that I have a decent grasp of what needed to be done with the code, and describing what the coding needed to do.

3) I honestly had difficulty with the coding aspect of the project, and that was an error on my part for not seeking assistance with that.

4) I would honestly try my best to do it in a much more timely manner, and take the time to revise each and every section, though, the biggest piece I would probably try to improve was to better describe the UML diagram and all the idiosyncrasies that go along with it.

5) I took the user needs and thought about how well it should be integrated into the system and program. The user is the one that, well, uses the program, and having it designed in such a way that their needs are met without being overly complicated is very important.

6) I honestly looked at what the client wanted, and looked at how to design the progam from there. Doing more research on each level, as well as taking the time to work on it piecemeal instead of all at once would also help.
